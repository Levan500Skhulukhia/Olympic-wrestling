            <h2>Induct John Smith Into the Olympic Hall of Fame</h2>
            <img src="./photo 2/john smith.png" alt="">
            <p>What more does John Smith need to do? Winning six consecutive World and Olympic titles from 1987 to 1992 set the standard for American wrestling. No U.S. wrestler had won more than two in a row before him.

                Only three Americans have won two Olympic wrestling golds: Smith, Bruce Baumgartner, and George Mehnert. Yet, only two wrestlers—Gable and Baumgartner—are in the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame. Smith isn’t one of them.
                
                Unlike sports with multiple events per Games, wrestlers have one shot every four years. Smith seized his chances and dominated. Recognized as one of the 100 Greatest Olympians in 1996, he's in every major hall of fame—except this one.
                
                This oversight must end. Induct John Smith and pave the way for other greats like Kenny Monday, Rulon Gardner, and Jordan Burroughs. Wrestling deserves better.</p>

                Murao, after claiming silver, stated simply, "I would like to aim for gold at the Los Angeles Olympics."
                
                Ngayap Hambou, competing in his first Olympics at 23, added to his resume after winning mixed team silver at the 2023 and 2024 world championships. "I wanted gold, but I’m still so happy with bronze," he said.
                
                Tselidis delivered Greece’s first medal of Paris 2024, defeating close friend Mosakhlishvili. "I made history—for me and for Greece. This feeling is amazing," he said. "He’s my best friend … but it’s sport."</p>
